# 📞 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction for Telecom Industry

> **Predicting customer churn and unlocking retention strategies with machine learning.**

---

## 📚 Project Summary
This repository presents a machine learning solution for predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. Using real-world data, we conducted end-to-end processing — from exploratory data analysis to model building, evaluation, and interpretability. Our goal: enable proactive retention strategies by accurately identifying customers at risk of leaving.

## 🔥 Key Project Features
- Comprehensive **EDA** to understand customer behavior patterns
- **Preprocessing pipelines**: handling missing values, feature encoding, scaling
- **Model Development**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier
- **Model Explainability**: SHAP analysis to interpret key churn drivers
- **Customer Segmentation**: Classifying customers into At Risk, Loyal, and Dormant
- **Actionable Insights**: Business recommendations to reduce churn rates

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn eli5 or SHAP
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-churn-prediction.git
cd telecom-churn-prediction
```

### Run the Notebooks
Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in sequence.

## 📈 Results
- **Accuracy Achieved:** _(Insert model performance metric, e.g., 86% accuracy)_
- **Top Churn Drivers:** Contract type, Monthly Charges, Tenure, Payment Method
- **Business Recommendations:**
  - Improve retention for month-to-month customers
  - Offer loyalty incentives to high-risk segments
  - Streamline payment methods for customer satisfaction

---

## 🤔 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Deep Learning modeling (ANNs)
- Deployment via Flask API / Streamlit dashboard
- Further analysis using SHAP for richer interpretability
